# HangmanGame
This is a classic Hangman game implemented in C++. Players can challenge themselves by guessing letters in a word while trying to avoid reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses. The game features varying difficulty levels, allowing for a tailored experience. Each incorrect guess brings players closer to being "hanged," making strategic thinking essential.
